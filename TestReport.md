# Integration approach
  La sequenza di integration utilizzata Ã¨ quella della big bang integration.
  __Product:__
    - step1: dao product testing
    - step2: controller product testing
    - step3: route product testing
    - step4: product integration testing
  __User:__
    - step1: dao user testing
    - step2: controller user testing
    - step3: route user testing
    - step4: user integration testing
  __Cart:__
    - step1: dao cart testing
    - step2: controller cart testing
    - step3: route cart testing
    - step4: cart integration testing
  __Review:__
    - step1: dao review testing
    - step2: controller review testing
    - step3: route review testing
    - step4: review integration testing
